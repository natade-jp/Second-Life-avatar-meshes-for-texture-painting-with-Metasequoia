### [Improved Second Life avatar meshes for 3D texture painting](http://web.archive.org/web/20120711023730/http://abbloch.com/slAvatars_OBJ_Fixed/)

- Pre-existing separate meshes are now combined into single meshes for each avatar body.
- UV maps for each body section (head, upperbody, lowerbody) are now arranged in separate UV tiles, to best facilitate use with 3D paint programs, such as Mudbox, Zbrush, Photoshop Extended, etc.
- Normals have been unlocked, and all edge normals have been softened.
- Pre-existing JPG texture files are not included, and references to them have been removed.
- Eyes, hair, and skirt meshes are not included.

### [Second Life avatar meshes for texture painting with Metasequoia](https://github.com/natade-jp/Second-Life-avatar-meshes-for-texture-painting-with-Metasequoia)

- Convert `*.obj` (Wavefront obj format) to `*.mqo` (Metasequoia mqo format).
